# TIC_TAC_TOE

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript.I have used validation checks to implement the game features. The UI is designed using CSS so it is easy to create. In the game, Player-1 starts playing the game and both players make their moves in consecutive turns. The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game. This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.
